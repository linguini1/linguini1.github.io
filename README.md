# Website

This contains the source code to my [personal website](https://linguini1.github.io). It contains some of my projects, as
well as blog posts.

The website is entirely static, however there is a build system composed of Python scripts for performing some menial
tasks, like including a title and navigation bar on each page. This allows me to make changes to core parts of the
website without having to go back and manually edit each file.

The website supports an RSS feed, which can be found [here](https://linguini1.github.io/rss.xml).
