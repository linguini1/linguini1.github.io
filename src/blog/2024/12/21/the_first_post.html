        <h1>The first post</h1>
        <p>
            I've finally gotten around to turning my website into a completely static site that just uses vanilla
            JavaScript, HTML and CSS, instead of relying on a huge React development environment and complex GitHub
            deployment workflow. It has the same features that I think keep it nice and simple: 1-bit theme with
            customization. However, I've now added a blog.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary purpose of the blog is to keep some useful information somewhere online, accessible and easy to
            share. As I complete projects, I am able to document some design choices or resources I used to make things
            easier for the next person to build off of. I do a lot of embedded work, and documenting how to start
            writing
            device drivers or select components is something that could be useful to a lot of people getting started. I
            found such articles to be an immensely helpful resource, and still do.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are quite a few cases in embedded where people writing software for certain devices are the first
            people
            to do it, or at least the first people to do it in the open source community. The documentation on some
            things
            is very lacking, which can make it tricky for newcomers. Plus, a lot of developers interested in embedded
            are
            usually doing some kind of hacking by re-purposing old devices or running their own code on devices that
            weren't
            supposed to be programmed by the end user. In such cases, documenting the process is an asset.
