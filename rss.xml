    Recently, I wrote an SPI driver for the BCM2711 as part of my ongoing
        effort to introduce Raspberry Pi 4B support into the NuttX kernel. While
        the implementation was relatively straightforward just using the BCM2711
        documentation, I encountered some difficulties that weren't immediately
        easy to figure out. Since the information about the BCM2711 is somew...

    After spending time 3D modelling my L1 certification rocket in
        Solidworks using my university rocketry team's subscription, I started
        getting into modelling other things for use in various projects around
        the team. The university had recently invested in a large 3D print farm
        using Prusa XL's, which design teams were able to book out and use for
        ...

    When I was getting into RTOSs, the first RTOS I experimented with was
        Blackberry's QNX. It's a microkernel, POSIX compliant, real-time
        operating system for embedded applications. However, I discovered soon
        after that its microkernel and security features came with the
        requirement of a system with a MMU. The only hobbyist device that QNX
        ran on at...

    I've finally gotten around to turning my website into a completely
        static site that just uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, instead of
        relying on a huge React development environment and complex GitHub
        deployment workflow. It has the same features that I think keep it nice
        and simple: 1-bit theme with customization. However, I've now added a
