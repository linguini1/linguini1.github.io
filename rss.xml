    Working on a project with my university's rocketry team got me thinking about my favourite QNX feature from when
        I was playing with that RTOS. One of the primary things that makes QNX unique is the fact that it is a
        microkernel ...

    Recently, I wrote an SPI driver for the BCM2711 as part of my ongoing
        effort to introduce Raspberry Pi 4B support into the NuttX kernel. While
        the implementation was relatively straightforward just using the BCM2711
        document...

    After spending time 3D modelling my L1 certification rocket in
        Solidworks using my university rocketry team's subscription, I started
        getting into modelling other things for use in various projects around
        the team. The unive...

    When I was getting into RTOSs, the first RTOS I experimented with was
